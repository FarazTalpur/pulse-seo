# Backend (Mock)

This folder holds mock data used by the Next.js API routes during early UI development.

## Structure
- `mock-data/`: JSON fixtures that power the API endpoints in `frontend/src/app/api/*`.

## Notes
- No server is required yet; the Next.js app reads these JSON files directly.
- Replace with a real service later (e.g., Node, Python, Go, or serverless).
